For Getting and Cleaning Data course project we have done the following step to complete the course project:
	First we have downloaded the UCI HAR Dataset.
	Load: activity labels.
	Load: data column names.
	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	Load and process X_test & y_test data.
	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	Load activity labels.
	Bind data.
	Load and process X_train & y_train data.
	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	Load activity data.
	Bind data.
	Merge test and train data.
	Apply mean function to dataset using dcast function.
